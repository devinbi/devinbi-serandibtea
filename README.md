SDG –  Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure 


Problem – 

•	The problems that we identified in our SD goal (industry, innovation and infrastructure) is, lack of technology promoted to industries in rural areas , lack of job opportunities and employee monitoring in rural areas , not motivated to use renewable energy , lack of research and development  . these factors have been affected to loss of skilled labor, decreased in growth of infrastructure, Industries that don't use technology to manage them aren't operating as they should.  Overall this leads to decline in the overall economic growth of the region. 



Solution-

•	Sri Lankan medium and small-scale tea industry is an excellent example of sustainable industry and innovation, where creating job opportunities in rural areas and promoting small industries go hand in hand with environmental conservation and technological advancement. As a solution we have decided to create a ERP system which includes main four functions (transport, equipment, inventory, employee) according to our research we identified that those are the best functions to improve sustainability and efficiency of this industry.
